# PassMan
Re-invented the wheel as exercise for python.
A (very) simple GUI credential Manager app tht stores encrypted passwords locally.

Python 3.7, tkinter 8.6, passlib, sqlite3, and pyperclip

You can run this app from terminal.

Activate Pyhton3.7 virtual env using venv :

<code>source venv local_path_to_repo/venv/bin/activate</code>

Then go to scripts folder :

<code>cd path_to_repo/scripts</code>

and run app :

<code>python PassMan.py</code>

Mess around and tell me where I went wrong. It works fine but I'm quite new to this, so I'm sure I messed up somewhere..

I also am working on packaging it using <a href="https://sveinbjorn.org/platypus">Platypus</a>.
Platypus works fine as long as you include all the scripts in the "scripts" directory for bundling.
All that is left to do is create an icon for it to look nicer...
